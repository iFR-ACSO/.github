# Optimization for Flight Control group

This is the public page of the Optimization for Flight Control group (formerly known as *ACSO*) at the Institute of Flight Mechanics and Controls (iFR) of the University of Stuttgart. The group is dedicated to the analysis of complex aerospace control systems by means of nonlinear systems theory and optimization, the development of algorithms for optimization-based approaches, and optimal control of nonlinear systems.
